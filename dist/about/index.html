I just know that it wasn't long after his birth - adrenalyn was still cursing through my veins, and the magical cocktail of thoughts and emotions were still very raw. I knew then all the photos and videos in the world would never do justice to what it really meant and felt. You always assume, somewhat naively, that you'll have time. Time to reflect, time to digest, and in my case time to take a million photos to document the hours, days, weeks and months. But it doesn't really work like that. Begin laughing now when you factor in that I'm Ciaran, the polar opposite of the word 'do'. And now here we are, on the eve of his 1st birthday, almost a year later. Time flies, and yet at the same time it doesn't. It's been an amazing year, a challenging year, and a beautifully enriching year that's surpassed every expectation - subconsciously or otherwise - of what it really means to be a father, a parent, and a husband.</p></div><div class="page-navigation"><div class="previous-chapter"><a href=""><p></p><p></p></a></div><div class="next-chapter"><a href=""><p></p><p></p></a></div></div></div><section class="copyright"><p>&copy Ciaran McCann 2021 - All Rights Reserved</p></section><script src="/assets/vendor.js?<%- Date.now() %>"></script><script src="/assets/main.js?<%- Date.now() %>"></script></body></html>
