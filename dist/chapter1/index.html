        <p>'Plop, the owl who was afraid of the dark', is a book my mother read to me as a child to overcome my fear of the dark. It's about a young barn owl who was having difficulty transitioning to adulthood, unable to realise his full potential due to his fear of all things night and dark. Which as you can imagine, would be quite hazardess for a bird of prey that relied on the cover of darkness for it's very existence. It's a beautiful book, cleverly written for children, and I remember it fondly. When Nici and I visited mum and dad in Tasmania shortly before travelling to Germany for our 2nd wedding celebration, mum handed me a package of drawings from when I was a child. In the same package was the well loved and preserved, if slightly tattered copy of the same book.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few months and Nici and I found ourselves sitting in a radiology room, expectantly looking at a live ultrasound of a 12 week old embryo.  It was exciting.  We couldn't see anything at Nici's initial 7 week scan, and we didn't expect to.  We were just happy to have confirmation that it was really happening, and were amazed to see this little blob of a heart beating away on the screen in front of us.  But this was different.  Now our little blob had become bigger and grown a head, with a stumpy pair of arms.  Not unlike a little barn owl.</p>
<p>Our little blob was now affectionately known as 'Plop'.</p>
