    <div class="text">
    
        <p>On Friday the 3rd of April Nici and I were both wide awake at 5am.  Nici had been waking early most mornings, finding it more difficult to lie comfortably in bed the later her pregnancy progressed.  The man pillow, as I affectionately called it, dominated the bed.  Towards the end of the pregnancy, it was like an on again off again relationship - some nights she needed it, others she didn't. I couldn't work out how it actually helped her, I just knew that each night I'd squeeze into bed next to my wife and an enormous man pillow.  It was very much 3 in the bed, and the little one said roll over, roll over, except they completely ignored him and started snoring instead.  In reality it was only Nici snoring, but at certain times in the dark of night, I swore it was the man pillow goading me.</p>
<p>But now there was silence.</p>
<p>Nici: &quot;Are you awake?  I can't sleep.  I've got this pain, it doesn't feel right.&quot;</p>
<p>There's one thing willing something to happen early, and then an altogether different thing when it actually appears to be happening.  Was it happening?  I remember smiling to myself as I lay there.  Is she in labour?  She couldn't be.  I mean we specifically stated just 12 hours prior that we really hoped this would happen, but it doesn't generally happen like that.  Not to me anyway. Does it?  I remember thinking if she is in labour, this would be really cool, because an afternoon birth would be much more preferable to one of those 4am things.  Plop pops out around 4 or 5pm, we could almost be home for a cheeky late night pizza and a glass of pinot.  Yes I know, giggle away.  It was just a fleeting thought in a moment of relaxed unreality. Well is that so bad? I'm nothing if not a dreamer. I mean I could have chosen not to share it with you, but I didn't do that did I? So go on, laugh away.</p>
<p>Me: &quot;Really?&quot;</p>
<p>Nici: &quot;It doesn't feel right&quot;.</p>
<p>Male mind steps in to lend assistance with internal thoughts.</p>
<p>Reasons to think this isn't happening: she had a proper check-up yesterday, there was no mention of Plop being 'in position&quot;.  We all know 'baby' can't come out prior to being 'in position', at which point they just hang, much like you would in a hammock, albeit head first, for about a week - which I'd conveniently visualised as Nici walking at 2 miles an hour hunched over with a grimace.  This hadn't happened, although that grimace thing did appear to be making a late entrance now I thought about it.</p>
<p>Reasons to think it is happening: you have absolutely no fucking idea about anything relating to a) child birth b) latter stages of pregnancy c) anything else in any way related to the female reproductive system or hammocks.</p>
<p>Nici is out of bed by this stage, but moving at 2 miles an hour.  So that's 2 out of 3 of the visual complete.  Shit, this actually could be happening.  Adrenalyn slowly starts to register attention, but in a very non committal sort of way.  This is fine, I mean it's unexpected, but definitely a good thing.  Apart from the fact that Bronte's still living with us, the car seat that I've been meaning to attach is lying in the hallway, and I'm still to pack that fucking 'hospital bag'.  Adrenalyn slowly begins to open his eyes.</p>
<p>At 6.30am Nici has her first contraction.  It lasts for 30 seconds.  Except I don't really know that it lasts for 30 seconds, because I'm still coming to terms with the fact that it's actually a contraction.  Nici is by this stage hunched over sitting on the side of the bed.  Hunched over. That's 3 out of 3. My visual is complete. Holy shit, this is game on.  Adrenalyn is fully awake now.  2 minutes later, Nici has another contraction.  It's 30 seconds.  I know this because I timed it.  Needless to say, adrenalyn has by this stage taken over.</p>
<p>30 second contractions 2 minutes apart.</p>
<p>Are you fucking kidding me?  Nobody told me this could happen.  The white board at the hospital said 10 seconds and mentioned 5 minutes in between - all while yawning with that condescending look of &quot;don't even think of calling the hospital drama queen, just put the kettle on&quot;. I know this because I have a picture of it on my phone.  Not the yawning bit but you get the picture. My visual was Nici sitting with a cup of tea and a tim tam, grimacing slightly while gently excusing herself mid conversation.  I am of course joking, but my point is it was supposed to be a marathon, not a fucking sprint.  Which is what I now appeared to be doing up and down the hallway in an attempt to get everything sorted before her next contraction started.  The inexperienced male partner correctly assumes that given the anticipated length of labour, much can be coordinated and sorted prior to getting to the hospital.  What the inexperienced male partner doesn't realise is that it's particularly difficult to achieve this when you only have a 2 minute window in which to operate.  If this was a marathon, I'd gravely underestimated the pace setters.</p>
