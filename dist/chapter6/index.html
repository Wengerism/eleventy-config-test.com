        <p>Nici had ordered a TENS machine to assist with pain management. She had every intention of having a natural birth without an epidural, but she was also open to the concept of having one if need be. For what it mattered, I completely supported her. People tell you varying degrees of information when it comes to child birth, but mostly you tend to hear the good bits. You know how it goes, I was a little late getting to the hospital, it was a bit stressful, but by the time I'd ordered my second earth mama natural uplifting tea, Ruby-Tuesday just slipped out like a piece of soap on a slippery slide. It was wonderful, empowering, and I ate the placenta.</p>
<p>Fuck off.</p>
<p>Fortunately Nici had some real friends who weren't afraid to tell it how it really is. She was under no illusions, and now that my visual of tim tams and a cup of tea had been shattered by the first contraction, neither was I. The problem was, given that Plop was due in 2 weeks time, we were scheduled to pick up the TENS machine the following day.</p>
<p>By this stage, Nici's contractions were showing no signs of getting any shorter or easier, and Nici found it helped if she pushed against the mantlepiece, and I pushed against her with all my unsubstantial weight. Inbetween contractions I was still running up and down the hallway - looking for things we needed to bring to the hospital, trying to think of things we needed to bring to the hospital, but mostly just running up and down the hallway. Bronte was still asleep in the end room, and I remember thinking it must seem really odd to wake up hearing Ciaran practising fartlek training up and down the hall. People were doing all forms of fitness training from home during covid, but this was very much out of character for this particular male occupant.</p>
<p>It's fair to say Nici was slightly more productive between contractions. She had managed to contact the TENS machine company, and arranged to pick up the machine that morning. And she texted Bronte, asking her if she could drive over to Darlinghurst to pick it up.</p>
<p>Before long, Bronte emerged from her room, just in time to see me flash past on route to getting Nici some fresh towels and underwear.</p>
<p>Bronte: &quot;Is Nici in Labour?&quot;</p>
<p>Me: &quot;Yes!&quot;</p>
<p>Bronte: &quot;It would have been nice to have been told!&quot;</p>
<p>This was a fuck me moment. I mean you have to laugh. Imagine the scene in a movie. I'm sprinting down the hall to the fresh laundry at the back of the house, desperately trying to be back in the bedroom and in position to push Nici into the mantelpiece by the start of her next contraction. I freeze, halfway through the living room, and gently and slowly retrace my steps to the door of Bronte's bedroom at the top of the hall. I look Bronte in the eye, before calmly stating &quot;I'm sorry Bronte, it must be awful not being told that Nici is in Labour, I mean that really was naughty and wrong of me wasn't it? How must that have made you feel? Gosh. I'm assuming you just got a text without any real context asking you to pick up a pain management machine? I mean I guess you could have imagined that she just wanted to try it out, but it must have been confusing for you, not to mention slightly rude. And goodness knows what you thought that loud moaning sound may have been emanating from the bedroom? And meantime here we are, having all this fun without you!&quot;</p>
<p>Needless to say that didn't happen, she cleverly worked out the rest, and she had the TENS machine picked up and back to us by 10am. Bless you Bronte. Which would have been brilliant, except they didn't give her the receptors and we couldn't use it. I couldn't believe it. I texted the owner and told her what had happened. To my amazement she responded stating this was in fact incorrect, it could not be possible, because she actually packed it herself. This was my second fuck me moment for the morning. Was it anti labour day or something and I didn't know about it? If I'd had time inbetween what were now 50 second contractions every 1 and a half minutes, I could have responded saying &quot;Oh, fair enough, silly me! Doubtless I'm just a complete fucking idiot with nothing better to do than text you while my wife is enduring a 50 second contraction every 1.5 minutes - sorry, my mistake! Keep up the great service, smiley face.&quot; God I wish I still had a copy of the text.</p>
<p>Needless to say I didn't respond. Shortly afterwards I received a second text from said owner saying she was indeed very sorry, and we could of course get a full refund.</p>
<p>Aha, super, my wife's thrilled to hear that. Listen, this is her celebratory moan..</p>
