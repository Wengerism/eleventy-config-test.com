    <div class="text">
    
        <p>At 9am I thought it prudent to call the birthing Center and give them a heads up that we would likely be heading in at some point.  The telephone number was clearly marked on Nici's yellow medical progress card, which made it easy.  What didn't make it easy was that I couldn't get through.  So I called RPA and spoke to the labour ward.  All good, they would give them a heads up.  They mentioned that despite Nici appearing to be in labour, it might not be the real deal.  She was 38 weeks after all.  Nici had been texting her friend Isa in Munich and she had mentioned the same thing.</p>
<p>They just always want to throw a wet blanket on everything don't they?  By this stage I was convinced that Nici was in labour, and semi-consciously I wasn't really conducive to false dawns.  I'd already texted my sisters saying clearly I'm not a midwife, but I'd be very surprised if Nici isn't in labour.  I'd purposely delayed texting just to be sure it was really on.  I called Deb, Nici's naturopath.</p>
<p>Deb was Rois' naturopath and doola 25 years prior when Clare was born, and by this stage a family friend - my entire family had all seen Deb professionally at some point.  More importantly, Deb had been the only person capable of explaining to Nici clearly and intelligently exactly what giving birth would be like.  Deb had explained that a big head isn't as big when tucked forward in the birth canal, and just how clever the cervix was at expanding.  This had been music to Nici's ears - she could forget husband's hats.</p>
<p>When I told Deb the length and frequency of the contractions, she was surprised.  There was no doubt Nici was in labour, and things were moving fast. She suggested a bath to slow things down and give Nici a rest.  Attention turned to car seats and that fucking hospital bag.  It's amazing how quickly you can get a car seat fitted under pressure, but there's always that nagging thought in the back of your head that says a real person is about to be sitting in that, try not fuck it up - oh and slightly terrified says hi by the way.</p>
<p>The bath was a godsend.  Nici took her foot off the pedal momentarily, and I had everything sorted.  Turns out that hospital bag thing isn't all that.  I assumed as much.  Ciaran 1 Societal expectations 0. I had everything, including a bluetooth speaker for the playlist I'd put together the week prior, and muesli bars as back up.</p>
<p>By this stage it was after 1pm.  Nici was back in 5th gear and I'd resumed sprinting up and down the hall.  Bronte, without so much as a word, had started clearing out her room.  I'd spoken to her about it a couple of weeks prior.  It was along the lines of we're approaching the finish line, and as much as we've enjoyed having you as a housemate, this will be a really special moment in our lives, and we don't particularly want to share it with anyone.  In terms of diplomacy, it was as smooth as a babies bottom.</p>
<p>Bronte: &quot;So you're kicking me out!?&quot;</p>
<p>Me: &quot;Yes. Basically as soon as Nici goes into labour, you need to be out, and preferably before so I have a fighting chance of preparing Plop's room&quot;.</p>
<p>Bronte left slightly upset.  It had been a crazy time for everyone, but her parents had sold their house and moved to the Gold Coast the year prior, which was unsettling for a 24 year old living at home with her parents. She had been living with us since.</p>
<p>Oh yes I know, I'm the bad guy, heartless bastard, Mr fucking insensitive.  Well consider this: those who may think living with a new born child might be all cuddles and candy, think again.  Who really wants to live in a 3 bedroom house with a newborn screamer and 2 leading candidates for the next series of the Walking Dead?  Not so much the bad guy now am I?  More like a saviour, knight in shining logic and reality.</p>
<p>I called the birthing center.  Couldn't get through.  I called the labour ward, they put me through.  It was that familiar tone of &quot;have your tried making a nice cup of tea?&quot;.</p>
<p>Me: &quot;Things are progressing rapidly here, I think we should come in now&quot;.</p>
<p>Midwife: &quot;Look, we normally really wouldn't advise coming in until her contractions are lasting closer to 1 minute with 2 minutes in-between.&quot;</p>
<p>Me: &quot;Her last contraction was over a minute, and they're 40 seconds apart&quot;.</p>
<p>Midwife: &quot;Right.  I think you should make your way in.&quot;</p>
<p>So here we go. It's that well rehearsed scene in every partner's mind. The bit were you slowly help your heavily breathing wife into the car and calmly drive her to the hospital, while taking any opportunity to glance over at her with a reassuring smile.  I mean it's not as if you have any control over the traffic, so what's the point being anxious?  It's certainly not going to help her is it?</p>
<p>Ever experienced a partner taking a 58 second contraction squarely on the chin at the traffic lights?  No mantlepiece in sight needless to say, and fairly tricky trying to push her lower back from the driver's seat. Normally a 3-4 km drive would be calculated in minutes, now it was calulated by number of contractions. There were at least 5.</p>
<p>Me: &quot;Get out of the fucking way you dickhead pedestrian!!  You're doing really well darlin, you're an absolute superstar, we'll be there in a second, we're all good, you've got this.  MOOOOOVE DICKHEAD!!&quot;</p>
<p>Finally the hospital doors were in front of us.  The birthing center was straight inside and to the right.  As Nici came through the doors a contraction started.  We had to sanitise on entry due to covid.  The woman behind  the dispenser was flapping with her mouth wide open in disbelief.</p>
<p>Woman: &quot;Is she ok?!&quot;</p>
<p>Me: &quot;She's fine, it's just a contraction&quot;</p>
<p>Just a contraction.</p>
<p>Listen to me. 10 minutes in the car screaming obscenities at the little green walky man and now I was Mr fucking midwife.</p>
<p>By contrast, the receptionist at the front desk had all the emotion of a Finnish F1 driver.</p>
<p>Receptionist: &quot;People never know what to do when they see someone having a contraction.  Isn't it funny?  I guess they haven't given birth. What's the name?  Oh you're in the birthing center are you?&quot;</p>
<p>Funny.  Wouldn't have been the first adjective that popped into my head, to be honest, but I could see her point.  I was starting to emanate a sense of calm. Isn't it funny how that seemed to coincide with arriving at the hospital?</p>
