This will be about finding out the sex, and how Fergus as a name came into the running.

Although if you have time, and let's just say you won't tonight, you should have a chapter on finding out Nici was pregnant, that you didn't even suspect and only had thoughts for well being, and that Fergus had technically shared her first proper guinness from the guinness factory, which is why he's such a grounded kid.
