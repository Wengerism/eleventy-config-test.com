Pregnancy feels like a marathon.

AND THIS IS AN EDIT!

I just said for that for a joke by the way.  I know, I'm male, what would I know about it?  What I mean to say is the anticipation that is waiting for 9 months to elapse, as a partner, feels like a marathon: it seems like there's just so many kms ahead. So you knuckle down, distract yourself, tick time off gradually, before it suddenly dawns on you that the finish line is just around the corner.

Except the finish line is really just the beginning.

I've never run a marathon by the way, but that's how I'd approach it. Except the finish would be the finish.  I digress.

Expecting.

At first you're excited, then slightly terrified, and then you settle for something closely approximating the middle: excited and slightly terrified.  At first it seemed like April 2020 was something approximating a year away.  Then as the months trickled past, it was more like 6 months.  Then xmas crept into view, we caught up with family, and the next thing I knew my sister was passing me a suitcase full of baby clothes while demonstrating how to operate a breast pump.

Thankfully there was ample booze on hand to compensate.  I'd originally thought I'd abstain from drinking during Nici's pregnancy as a sign of support.As it happened, it appeared more appropriate to drink 'for' her.  I've always been a big fan of vicarious reinforcement, and I was with her every step of the way.

With 3 sisters, all of whom are mothers, there was no shortage of advice on hand when the subject of childbirth inevitably arose.  Rois had a mantra: small head, big fanny.  And no, I'm not making this up.  Fanny?  You couldn't make that up. Needless to say it was a girly group discussion at the local spa resort - a location my sisters usually reserved for sharing birth stories over bubbles after each sister had their first child.

Small head.  Seems obvious enough.  I'm not a big bloke, and although I have no idea on which percentile my head rests, there was nothing to suggest Plop would be a big lump.  The only thought in my mind as Nici undertook her 28 week scan was how much more developed will Plop be?  And by this I mean I had no idea.  I hadn't been reading any books, and I had no expectations - we knew the sex, but the rest would just be a surprise.  And I wasn't prepared to entertain negative thoughts, so a healthy baby was assumed.  This was definitely the excited bit - slightly terrified was nowhere to be seen.

Nici on the other hand, was sitting on the fence.  Technically lying on the fence given the circumstances.  She was wearing her emotionless face, the one she reserves for instances beyond her control.

The sonographer was chatty.  Like one of those hilariously at ease nurses that have been there, done that, seen everything, and happy to talk about it.

Nici: "Is it a big head?"

Sonographer: "Oh yep, heh, it's a BIG head"

I looked at Nici.  Her face had moved from emotionless to emotionless with hint of terror.  Did she really just say that?

The songraper continued.

Sonographer:  "My son has a really big head too.  I've had to buy him so many hats, it's crazy, he just keeps growing out of them.  In the end I just stopped buying them, and now he just wears my husband's.  I don't know if it will grow any bigger, but I hope not, you know, it's big enough.  But yeah, it's a big head".

Nici turned to me in horror, then back to the sonographer, then back to the monitor.  Her face didn't change a beat, while all the time projecting a thought bubble of please tell me she's taking the piss.

I know I shouldn't have, but it took every fiber of my being not to piss myself laughing on the spot.  The sonographer was hilarious, this was dark humour at its best, and she seemed completely oblivious.  I love dark humour.

Nici's face was priceless.

Small head, big fanny.

Not any more.
