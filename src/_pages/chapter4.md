On Thursday the 2nd of April, I drove Nici to the hospital in the afternoon for her scheduled 38 week check-up with a paediatrician.  Covid was ramping up, and I wasn't allowed to attend.   Nici called me from the appointment and left her phone on loud speaker so I could hear.  It was raining.  Not heavy rain, just drizzly London crap, but enough to make it difficult to hear from inside the car.

Nici was concerned.  She knew that at her age she was predisposed to being induced at 40 weeks.  Her pregnancy had been seamless, and she wanted to let nature run its course.

I was concerned about being able to attend the birth, not to mention supporting Nici through her labour.  Stories had emerged from Europe of partners unable to attend, watching from afar through the window.  I cringed at the thought, surely it would be counter productive to exclude me?  We were told that RPA had no plans to exclude partners, it would be a last resort decision, but covid was changing the landscape daily, and it couldn't be discounted.

Nici didn't want to be induced, and neither of us could stomach the thought of me not attending.  And suddenly you find yourself sitting in the driving seat of a parked car in the rain, muttering to yourself, while your wife slowly makes her way to the car gently talking to her stomach.  Let's not piss about Plop, we're in the midst of a global pandemic that feels like it's about to explode. Let's get it done, and get you home.  It's time to get it on.

Plop was listening.
