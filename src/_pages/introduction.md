This is a recollection of the story of Fergus' birth, from my perspective. It includes moments leading up to his birth - basically anything I deemed significantly relevant to the story.

Although I had intended to write a shorter version of this many months ago, when I started writing I knew it might be a little bit bigger. I honestly don't know when I had the initial thought, but it wasn't too long after his birth. Thoughts, emotions, and memories were still very raw. At the time I was conscious of writing it down in an attempt to not forget it. And this remains the objective.

2020 was a strange year for everyone. But let's not kid ourselves. As a country we were, and still are, incredibly lucky. What pandemic? That said, in March and April of 2020 we didn't know what we were walking into, but we knew it involved egg shells. To say I was anxious would be the understatement of the decade. If mantras are your thing, lets call it "healthy wife, healthy baby, healthy home".

As it turned out, Fergus made his way into this crazy world smack bang at the beginning of a global pandemic that continues to plough on. But for us, as a family in a rich country, it was an excuse to pull down the shutters, secure in our inner west Sydney bubble. To this day Fergus remains at home, and Nici and I share his new world with him every day. For this, I am enormously grateful.

I wouldn't want it any other way.

I've never laughed as much, cried as much, or smiled as much as I have in the past 12 months.

Long may it continue.
