This is a recollection of the story of Fergus' birth, from my perspective.

Although I had intended to write a shorter version of this many months ago, the truth is I can't completely remember when I had the initial thought. I just know that it wasn't long after his birth - adrenalyn was still cursing through my veins, and the magical cocktail of thoughts and emotions were still very raw. I knew that all the photos and videos in the world would never do justice to how it really meant and felt at the time. You always assume, somewhat naively, that you'll have time. Time to reflect, time to digest, and in my case time to take a million photos to document the hours, days, weeks and months. But it doesn't really work like that. Begin laughing now when you factor in that I'm Ciaran, the polar opposite of the word 'do'. And now here we are, on the eve of his 1st birthday, almost a year later. Time flies, and yet at the same time it doesn't. It's been an amazing year, a challenging year, and a beautifully enriching year that's surpassed every expectation I held - subconsciously or otherwise - of what it really means to be a father, a parent, and a husband.
