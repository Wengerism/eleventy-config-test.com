Can I just start by saying, with the greatest love and respect, that you are at times a complete pain in the arse.

Do you have any idea how tricky it is to sit down and get in the groove to write something like this in 2 hr windows when you're exhausted from entertaining your 13 month old boy for several hours, and just managed to get him down for a sleep?

You know that part when I come in and fall on the couch at 9pm having written furiously for the past 3 hours, in-between helping to feed and bath Fergus and get him to bed? And then I don't respond really well to you poking the inside of my ear, while simultaneously telling me why you think investing in 5er might be the answer to our financial problems?  Because you've been researching the share market for at least 5 minutes, and this is how it works.

Strange that I don't really have the appetite for being told that mothers day is in fact on Sunday, and you have BIG expectations of what that day should look like.  BIG.  And what exactly do I have prepared? Prompting thoughts in my head to change from do I need to include the bit about the 28 week scan, to how the fuck am I going to arrange a picnic while also writing half of this on Saturday?  I mean where are the points for originality?  Know any other husbands that thought a nice idea for a mothers day present might be to reconstruct memories of their only childs birthing story, and put it into prose?  Excuse me for a moment while I mop away the tears from my desk.

Or how about the bit were I tell you that it's really important for me to have the majority of Saturday (the day before Mothers Day) to do some REALLY IMPORTANT work - complete with hand gestures to illustrate the severity of the situation - and you respond with "is it ok if I go the gym in the morning for 2 hours with Eileen?"  (See point above relating to difficulty writing when sleep deprived and exhausted having entertained 13 month old boy for several hours).

And how about the bit when I'm trying to block out all the external noise - namely fergus screaming - by standing in the shower attempting to formulate what sections I could write about, only to be told to hurry up and get on with doing some 'work'?

So when I finally do get a clear run from the shower, to the coffee machine, to my desk, all the while writing sentences as I walk, isn't it great to have my train of thought ambushed with the subtle suggestion that I should instead spend the morning arranging car insurance and registration?  Did I mention that I used to work in the insurance industry in a past life?  I'm sorry did I say train of thought, I meant train wreck, I do apologise.

So here I am, sitting at my desk, contemplating whether it would be more therapeutic to burn or tear said insurance documents that now cover my desk, prior to completing the rest of this little jaunt down memory lane.  Or should I resort to the tried and trusted dramatic right armed sweep of the desk?  Problem is lately I've been having this longing for tidiness and order - a daily tug of war with a 13 month old boy - and I really can't be arsed having to pick everything up off the floor.

I resort to pulling a face.  And holding it while increasing the intensity.

On a positive note, that's the preface taken care of.
